# Lading Page exercise from The Odin Project

I have the task to create a **landing page** and **no matter the topic**, just follow the image reference what they give you. The matter here is that *doing the reference* and trying to *avoid being perfect* and pixel-perfect. Just do it and have **fun**. Understanding what you are doing is better and you can find help in the web too!
